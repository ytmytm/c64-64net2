Information below is obsolete. 64net/2 currently compiles and works on Linux.

Windows binary can be built using MINGW (www.ming.org) but its internet subset
was not tested. It has problems described below in MS-DOS/Win95 target. Windows
binary needs inpout32.dll that is distributed together with 64net/2. It will
work only on Win95/98. You need to edit Makefile and config.h.
