You can use standard null-modem rs232 cable between C64/128 with
Swiftlink and the host, but be warned that it is not very reliable.
It works at 9600 baud, and there are no problems with LOAD or SAVE,
but avoid executing commands that may result in scrolling the
screen because everything may lock then.
