64NET/2 (C) Copyright Paul Gardner-Stephen, 1992-1997

	As of the 15th of December 1997, 64NET/2 shall be freely available.

The reasoning behind this is fairly simple;  im not going to make a living from
it, and i would like to see more people able to use it.
	The behind the scenes info is also fairly simple, with myself being
reminded how hard drives are liable to go "pop" at in-opportune intervals,
as a result the 64net/2 source was almost lost (and has been revived from 12
month old source).

The 64NET/2 public license:

	64NET/2 is now covered by the gnu public license v2, or any later
version, at your option. 
	64NET/2 may not be used in a business environment, or sold without the
express written permission of the author.
	The author is Paul Gardner-Stephen.

The authoritative source tree will be maintained here, on hld.c64.org.
Soon i aim to set up a FreeBSD.org style CVS system to allow contributions and
manipulation of the source tree by a yet-to-be-nominated 64net core team. 
Basically, i aim for 64net to do as much as it possibly can for the c64 world.
This is only enhanced by making the source code publicly available.

Paul Gardner-Stephen.
