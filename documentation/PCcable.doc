This file contains information on building the 64NET/2 cable.

*64NET/2 uses a _DIFFERENT_ cable to 64net v1*
(This is for improved reliability, as well as speed).

The 64NET/2 cable uses 12 pin-to-pin connections as follows:

Printer Port	User Port
1		B
2		C
3		D
4		E
5		F
6		H
7		J
8		K
9		L
10		8
11		M
18		N

HINTS:

A 64NET v1 cable can usually be easily modified to this configuration
provided it uses 12 core (or greater) cable.

If you are constructing a new 64NET/2 cable, buy a printer cable
designed for an IBM compatible, remove the centronics connector, and
solder the C64 user port connector in place.  This saves the hassle of
soldering the DB25 (which is by far harder than soldering a low-guage
edge connector, ie user port).

TROUBLE SHOOTING:

If you have difficulty building the cable, contact your local 64NET
dealer, where you will be able to purchase one at a reasonable price.

It is unlikely that this cable will operate with runs of >5m (due to
the general cruftiness of most PC Parallel ports).  You may be
fortunate enough to have longer runs function, however it is
recommended that you do not.  If you *really* *really* have to, buy
high quality cable (eg type 5 cable desgined for 100mbit networking,
or for "think net").  Oxygen free copper is also a help.  It is
usually a combination of interference and drop of signal (PC printer
ports are usually pushed through a set of capacitors, which
drastically limit current) which kills the connections.  Be aware that
the 64NET/2 cable can be strobing signals at upto 33Mhz, so reasonable
soldering is necessary. 

Be warned that you need a LPT interface with bidirectional transfer
ablility. You can't set LPT mode to SPP/ECP/EPP - the cable won't work
with these settings.
